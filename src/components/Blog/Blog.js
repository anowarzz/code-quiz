          1. What Is The Purpose Of React Router ?
        </h3>

        <p className="mt-6 text-lg">
          React Router, and dynamic, client-side routing, allows us to build a
          single-page web application with navigation without the page
          refreshing as the user navigates. React Router uses component
          structure to call components, which display the appropriate
          information.

        <p className="mt-6 text-lg">
          The Context API can be used to share data with multiple components,
          without having to pass data through props manually. It makes it
          possible to pass data from parent to children nested deep down the
          component tree directly, instead of passing it down through a chain of
          props.It can be used to solve the same problems as Redux does, but it
          doesnâ€™t provide a strict way of state manipulation to ensure
          predictable behavior. Despite its low-level nature, it might be the
          perfect solution in some cases

        <h3 className="text-3xl p-2 ">3. What Is UseRef Hook ?</h3>

        <p className="mt-6 text-lg">
          The useRef is a hook that allows to directly create a reference to the
          DOM element in the functional component. <br />

            <code

            >
              const refContainer = useRef(initialValue);
            </code>
            <br />
          </p>
          const refContainer = useRef(initialValue); The useRef returns a
          mutable ref object. This object has a property called .current. The
          value is persisted in the refContainer.current property. These values
          are accessed from the current property of the returned object. The
          .current property could be initialised to the passed argument
          initialValue e.g. useRef(initialValue). The object can persist a value
          for a full lifetime of the component.
